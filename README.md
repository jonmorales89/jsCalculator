# Calculator

## Designed and Developed by Jonathan Morales

### Description
One of the first projects completed while I was enrolled at LearningFuze Web Development program. The project was intended to reinforce the foundational JavaScript/jQuery priciples we were learing at the time. I developed the project using jQuery to handle to calculator logic, element selection, and dom creation. The design was inspired by Google's Material Design.
